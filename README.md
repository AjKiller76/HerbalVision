HerbalVision

HerbalVision is a deep learning-based leaf classification project that uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify different types of leaves. This project leverages TensorFlow and Keras to train a model for recognizing leaf images and predicting their respective categories.

Features
1)Loads and preprocesses leaf images for classification
2)Uses a CNN model to classify leaf types
3)Provides high accuracy in classification
4)Saves and loads trained models for future inference


Dataset

The dataset is stored in a CSV file (Leaf_1.csv) containing:
file_path: The path to the leaf image.
label: The category of the leaf.
